  <p class="text">All or Nothing is a pop-ballad by American boy band O-town. It was #1 on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 from July 28th to August 24th 2001. In 2000, the five members of O-Town met on the reality t.v. show, "Making the Band." The group was named O-Town becasue the show's auditions took place in Orlando, Florida. At the height of their popularity, they opened for Birtney Spears 2001 "Dream within a Dream" Tour in the Unites States. The boy band had two big hit songs. Their first was the single "Liquid Dreams" from their self-titled first album. Their second, and most successful, single was "All or Nothing." O-Town performed as a group until 2003 when boy bands and teen pop lost popularity. In 2013, three of the original members of O-Town got the band back together and have since released two more albums.</p>
